# Wolfenstein_Style_Engine_Using_CPP
This is a prijecct I made in my 2nd year for college.
It is a text based renderer which tries to mimic old game engines like Wolfenstein or Doom.

Steps to get this code running:
  1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio.
  2. After setting it up properly create a new console project for C++ (Win32 Console Application) and make it an empty project.
  3. Now paste the code in Game_Engine_1.cpp to your project file.
  4. Run.

Note:
For a normal Full HD monitor, make sure to change the console default size values to 240x80 (or anything with the same resolution, whichever works the best for you) and set the font to "Consolas" with font size 8 and line height depending on your screen size.
These are the values that worked the best for me, you might have to tinker with it a bit to get the best results.
